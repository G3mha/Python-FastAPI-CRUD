Project developed for the **Big Data** course in the **Computer Engineering** program at **Insper**.

## Objective

The project aims to develop a microservice for managing gym members and plans.

For this purpose, a RESTful API was created to manage the registration of gym members and plans, following the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) model. The API offers the following functionalities:

- Users can manage member registration, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting member information.
- Users can manage plan registration, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting plan information.

## Tools Used

The API uses Python's FastAPI framework.

To integrate it with a database, SQLAlchemy was used, which is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for Python. SQLAlchemy allows users to write Python code to manipulate a database without having to write SQL directly. PostgreSQL was chosen as the database for the project.
